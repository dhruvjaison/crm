## 🚀 **How to Test on Vercel**

### 1. Visit Your Calendar

Go to: `https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard/calendar`

You should see:
- A beautiful calendar interface
- "Connect Google Calendar" button
- Calendar is empty (no events yet)

### 2. Connect Google Calendar (Optional)

**To enable Google Calendar sync:**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create new project or select existing
3. Enable "Google Calendar API"
4. Go to Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID
5. Choose "Web application"
6. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback`
   - `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback`
7. Copy Client ID and Client Secret
8. Add to Vercel environment variables:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback
   ```

9. Click "Connect Google Calendar" on the calendar page
10. Authorize the app
11. Click "Sync" to import events

Even without Google Calendar, you can:
